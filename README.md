During the Texas winter storm of February 2021, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (aka ERCOT) showed how woefully ill-equipped the Texas power grid was to meet the energy demands of a natural disaster. 

This application is something I made during the much less severe 2022 winter storm. It scrapes the [ERCOT real time system conditions page](https://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/html/real_time_system_conditions.html) to grab the current system demand and capacity. It then checks if demand exceeds capacity and posts a gif to the page accordingly.
